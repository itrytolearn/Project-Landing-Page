               <img class="queen-bee" src="./img/queen-bee.jpg" alt="queen">
               <p class="card-text">Queen: One queen runs the whole hive. Her job is to lay the eggs that will spawn the hive’s next generation of bees. The queen also produces chemicals that guide the behaviour of the other bees.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <img class="drone-bee" src="./img/drone.png" alt="drone">
                <p class="card-text">Drones: These are the male bees, and their purpose is to mate with the new queen. Several hundred live in each hive during the spring and summer. But come winter, when the hive goes into survival mode, the drones are kicked out!</p>

                <img class="worker-bee" src="./img/worker.jpg" alt="worker">
                <p class="card-text">Workers: these are all female and their roles are to forage for food (pollen and nectar from flowers), build and protect the hive, clean and circulate air by beating their wings. Workers are the only bees most people ever see flying around outside the hive.</p>
